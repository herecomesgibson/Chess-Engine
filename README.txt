[WIP]
In addition to being unfinished, this engine currently is in need of some refactoring, so to whoever is reading this... I'm sorry and don't judge me, I know it's not pretty

This engine can currently generate all pseudo legal moves

Functionality in progress:

filtering moves in the generate_legal_moves function such that the moves are all indeed legal moves i.e. checks, castling, en passant
