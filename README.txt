[WIP]
In addition to being unfinished, this engine currently is in need of some refactoring, so to whoever is reading this... I'm sorry and don't judge me, I know it's not pretty

this engine is in the process of being able to generate all legal moves in a given position.
the engine is currently generating moves for:
king
knight
bishop
rook
pawn



It is currently missing
Queen moves
psuedo-legal but not legal moves i.e. checks, castling, en passant
